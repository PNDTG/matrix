# Matrix
This is a basic implementation for Matrix calculations and manipulation, more meant as a learning experience.

My goal is to better understand underlying matrix calculations, multi threaded calculations and algorithm optimization.
And hopefully to someday implement a full GPU hardware accelared matrix calculations.
Very useful for my personal Artificial Neural Network mathematics.
